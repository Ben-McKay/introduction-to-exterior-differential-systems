Lectures notes on exterior differential systems.
The file main.tex should compile under pdflatex to provide these lecture notes, producing a file main.pdf.
That pdf file is too large to appear here; you can find a version on the Kazakhi server at http://93.174.95.27/search.php?req=mckay%2C+benjamin&lg_topic=libgen&open=0&view=simple&res=25&phrase=1&column=def and a version on the arxiv at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.09697.pdf.
