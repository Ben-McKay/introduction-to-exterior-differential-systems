\section{Background material from differential geometry}
By the expression \emph{analytic},\SubIndex{analytic} we mean \emph{real analytic}.
We assume that all of our manifolds, maps, vector fields and differential forms are analytic.
(In a few exercises, we describe some such thing as \emph{smooth}, i.e. \(C^{\infty}\), not necessarily analytic.)
A \emph{submanifold}\define{submanifold} is an immersion of manifolds, defined up to diffeomorphism of the domain.
Denote the dimension of a manifold \(M\) by \(\dim M\).
The \emph{codimension}\define{codimension} of a submanifold \(S\) of \(M\) is \(\dim M - \dim S\).
A \emph{hypersurface}\define{hypersurface} in a manifold \(M\) is a submanifold of codimension one.
A \emph{hyperplane}\define{hyperplane} in a vector space \(V\) is a linear subspace \(W\subset V\) so that \(\dim (V/W)=1\).


\section{Differential equations encoded in differential forms}
To express a differential equation \(0=f\of{x,u,\pderiv{u}{x}}\), add a variable \(p\) to represent the derivative \(\pderiv{u}{x}\).
Let \(\vartheta\defeq du-p \, dx\), \(\omega\defeq dx\). Let \(M\) be the manifold \(M\defeq\Set{(x,u,p)|0=f\of{x,u,p}}\) (assuming it is a manifold).
Any submanifold of \(M\) on which \(0=\vartheta\) and \(0\ne \omega\) is locally the graph of a solution.
It is easy to generalize this to any number of variables and any number of equations of any order.

\section{Exterior differential systems}
An \emph{integral manifold}\define{integral!manifold}\define{manifold!integral} of a collection of differential forms is a submanifold on which the forms vanish.
An \emph{exterior differential system} on a manifold \(M\) is an ideal \(\II \subset \Omega^*\) of differential forms, closed under exterior derivative, and \emph{graded}, i.e. splitting into a direct sum
\[
\II=\II^1 \oplus \dots \oplus \II^{\dim M}
\]
of forms of various degrees: \(\II^k \defeq \II \cap \Omega^k\).
\prob{generate.system}{Prove that any collection of differential forms has the same integral manifolds as the exterior differential system it generates.}
\begin{example}
Some trivial examples: the exterior differential system generated by
\begin{enumerate}
\item \(0\),
\item \(\Omega^*\), 
\item the pullbacks of all forms via a submersion,
\item \(dx^1 \wedge dy^1 + dx^2 \wedge dy^2\) in \(\R[4]\),
\item \(dy-z \,dx\) on \(\R[3]\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}
\prob{trivial.integral.manifolds}{What are the integral manifolds of our trivial examples?}%
\begin{answer}{trivial.integral.manifolds}%
\begin{enumerate}
\item All submanifolds.
\item Any discrete set of points. 
\item Take a \(0\)-dimensional submanifold of the image.
Its preimage is a submanifold. 
Take any submanifold of that submanifold.
\item If \(dx^1 \wedge dx^2 \ne 0\), these are locally \(y_i=\pderiv{S}{x_i}\); in general the integral surfaces are the Lagrangian surfaces.
\item If \(dx\ne 0\) these are \(y=y(x)\), \(z=dy/dx\); in general they are Legendre curves.
\end{enumerate}
\end{answer}
By definition \(\II^0=0\), i.e. there are no nonzero functions in \(\II\).
If we wish some functions to vanish, we can replace our manifold \(M\) by the zero locus of those functions (which might not be a manifold, a technical detail we will ignore).

\section{Integral elements}
An \emph{integral element}\define{integral!element}\define{element!integral} of an exterior differential system \(\II\) is a linear subspace of a tangent space, on which all forms in \(\II\) vanish.
Every tangent space of any integral manifold is an integral element, but some integral elements of some exterior differential systems don't arise as tangent spaces of integral manifolds.
A \(1\)-dimensional integral element is an \emph{integral line}\define{integral!line}\define{line!integral}. 
A \(2\)-dimensional integral element is an \emph{integral plane}.\define{integral!plane}\define{plane!integral}
\prob{trivial.integral.elements}{What are the integral elements of our trivial examples?}%
\begin{answer}{trivial.integral.elements}%
\begin{enumerate}
\item All linear subspaces of all tangent spaces.
\item The zero subspaces of all tangent spaces.
\item The linear subspaces tangent to the fibers.
\item If \(dx^1 \wedge dx^2 \ne 0\), these are \(dy_i=a_{ij} dx_j\) with \(a_{ij}=a_{ji}\); in general they are zero subspaces, lines, or Lagrangian planes.
\item If \(dx\ne 0\) these are \(dy = z \, dx\), \(dz = a \, dx\) for any real number\(a\).
\end{enumerate}
\end{answer}
\prob{one.d}{Suppose that the \(1\)-forms in an exterior differential system span a subspace of constant rank in each cotangent space.
Prove that there is an integral curve tangent to each integral line.}
\prob{proof.Cartan.Kaehler:nonchar}{Give an example of an embedded integral manifold, whose every tangent space is a hyperplane in a unique integral element, but which is not a hypersurface in an integral manifold.}
\begin{answer}{proof.Cartan.Kaehler:nonchar}
\(M=\R\), \(\II=(x \, dx)\), \(X=\set{0}\)
\end{answer}
\prob{eds:int.elt.k.forms}{Prove that a \(k\)-dimensional linear subspace of a tangent space is an integral element of an exterior differential system \(\II\) just when all \(k\)-forms in \(\II\) vanish on it.}
The \emph{polar equations}\define{polar equation} of an integral element \(E\) are the linear functions
\[
w \in T_m M \mapsto \vartheta(w,e_1,e_2,\dots,e_k)
\]
where \(\vartheta\in\II^{k+1}\) and \(e_1,e_2,\dots,e_k\in E\), for any \(k\).
They vanish on a vector \(w\) just when the span of \(\set{w}\cup E\) is an integral element.
The set of polar equations of \(E\) is a linear subspace of \(T_m^* M\).
If an integral element \(E\) lies in a larger one \(F\), then all polar equations of \(E\) occur among those of \(F\): larger integral elements have more (or at least the same) polar equations.
\prob{trivial.integral.polar}{What are the polar equations of the integral elements of our trivial examples?}
An \emph{integral flag}\define{integral!flag} of an exterior differential system is a sequence of nested integral elements
\[
0=E_0 \subset E_1 \subset E_2 \subset \dots \subset E_p
\]
with dimensions \(0,1,2,\dots,p\).
\emph{Danger:} most authors require that a flag have subspaces of all dimensions; we \emph{don't}: we only require that the subspaces have all dimensions \(0,1,2,\dots,p\) up to some dimension \(p\).
Successive subspaces have successively larger space of polar equations.
The \emph{characters}\define{character} \(s_0,s_1,\dots,s_p\) of the flag are the increments in rank of polar equations: \(E_k\) has polar equations of rank \(s_0+s_1+\dots+s_k\).

Consider all flags inside a given \(E_p\).
Polar equations remain linearly independent under small motions of a flag.
So if a flag in \(E_p\) has maximal dimensional polar equations, i.e. character sums \(s_0,s_0+s_1,\dots,s_0+\dots+s_p\),  then so do all nearby flags in \(E_p\).   
The \emph{characters} of the integral element \(E_p\) are those of any such flag.
\prob{trivial.integral.chars}{What are the characters of the integral flags of our trivial examples?}

\section{Integral elements as points of the Grassmann bundle}
The rank \(p\) \emph{Grassmann bundle}\define{Grassmann bundle} of a manifold \(M\) is the set of all \(p\)-dimensional linear subspaces of tangent spaces of \(M\).
\prob{Grassmann.bundle.charts}{Recall how charts are defined on the Grassmann bundle. Prove that the Grassmann bundle is a fiber bundle.}%
\begin{answer}{Grassmann.bundle.charts}%
Take any local coordinates on \(M\), say \(x^i,u^a\), near a point \(m_0\).
Every \(p\)-plane \(E \subset T_m M\), with \(m\) near \(m_0\), and with \(dx^1\wedge \dots \wedge dx^p \ne 0\) on \(E\), is the set of tangent vectors on which \(du^a = q^a_i \, dx^i\), for uniquely determined numbers \(q^a_i\).
As a short hand, write this as \(du=q \, dx\).
The functions \(x^i,u^a,q^a_i\) on \(\Gr{p}{M}\) are local coordinates.
The map \((m,E)\in\Gr{p}{M} \mapsto m\in M\) is \((x,u,q)\mapsto (x,u)\), a submersion.
We leave the change of coordinates to the reader.%
\end{answer}
The integral elements of an exterior differential system \(\II\) form a subset of the Grassmann bundle.
We would like to see if that subset is a submanifold, and predict its dimension.

\section{\texorpdfstring{The Cartan--K\"ahler theorem}{The Cartan--Kaehler theorem}}
An integral element, say of dimension \(p\) and with characters \(s_0,\dots,s_p\), \emph{predicts}\define{predicted dimension} the dimension \(\dim M + s_1+2s_2+\dots+ps_p\).
It predicts \emph{correctly} if the nearby integral elements form a submanifold of the Grassmann bundle of the predicted dimension.
(We will see that they always sit in a submanifold of the predicted dimension.)
An integral element which correctly predicts dimension is \emph{involutive}\define{involutive}.
An exterior differential system on a manifold \(M\) is \emph{involutive} if each component of \(M\) contains an involutive maximal integral element.
(We will see that involutivity of an exterior differential system implies that involutive integral elements occur at a dense open subset of points of \(M\).)
\begin{theorem}[Cartan--K\"ahler]\label{theorem:CK}\define{Cartan--K\"ahler theorem}\define{theorem!Cartan--K\"ahler}
Every involutive integral element of any analytic exterior differential system is tangent to an analytic integral manifold.
\end{theorem}
\prob{eds:change.rank}{Give an example of an exterior differential system whose characters are not constant.}
\begin{answer}{eds:change.rank}
If \(\theta=du-q^2 \, dx\) then \(d\theta = - 2q \, dq \wedge dx\).
\end{answer}

\section{Example: Lagrangian submanifolds}
We employ the Cartan--K\"ahler theorem to prove the existence of Lagrangian submanifolds of complex Euclidean space.
Let
\[
\vartheta \defeq dx^1 \wedge dy^1  + 
dx^2 \wedge dy^2  + 
\dots
+
dx^n \wedge dy^n.
\]
Let \(\II\) be the exterior differential system generated by \(\vartheta\) on \(M\defeq\R[2n]\).
Writing spans of vectors in angle brackets,
\[
\begin{array}{@{}r@{}c@{}lll@{}}
\toprule\multicolumn{3}{@{}l@{}}{\textrm{Flag}} & 
\textrm{Polar equations} & \textrm{Characters}\\
\cmidrule(r){1-3}\cmidrule(lr){4-4}\cmidrule(l){5-5}
E_0&=&\set{0}&\set{0} & s_0=0 \\
E_1&=&\spn{\partial_{x^1}}&\spn{dy^1} & s_1=1 \\
&\vdotswithin{=}&&\vdotswithin{\spn{dy^1}}&\vdotswithin{=}  \\
E_n&=&\spn{\partial_{x^1},\partial_{x^2},\dots,\partial_{x^n}}&\spn{dy^1,dy^2,\dots,dy^n} & s_n=1 \\
\bottomrule
\end{array}
\]
The flag predicts
\[
\dim M + s_1 + 2 \, s_2 + \dots + n \, s_n 
=
2n + 1+2+\dots+n.
\]
The nearby integral elements at a given point of \(M\) are parameterized by \(dy=a \, dx\), which we plug in to \(\vartheta=0\) to see that \(a\) can be any symmetric matrix.
So the space of integral elements has dimension
\[
\dim M + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 2n + \frac{n(n+1)}{2},
\]
correctly predicted.
The Cartan--K\"ahler theorem proves the existence of Lagrangian submanifolds of complex Euclidean space, one (at least) through each point, tangent to each subspace \(dy= a \, dx\), at least for any symmetric matrix \(a\) close to \(0\).
\begin{problem}{eds:sLag}
On a complex manifold \(M\), take a K\"ahler form \(\vartheta\) and a holomorphic volume form \(\Psi\), i.e. closed forms expressed in local complex coordinates as
\begin{align*}
\vartheta &= \frac{\sqrt{-1}}{2} g_{\mu \bar\nu} dz^{\mu} \wedge dz^{\bar\nu}, \\
\Psi &= f(z) \, dz^1 \wedge dz^2 \wedge \dots \wedge dz^n,
\end{align*}
with \(f(z)\) a holomorphic function and \(g_{\mu \bar\nu}\) a positive definite self-adjoint complex matrix of functions.
Prove the existence of \emph{special Lagrangian submanifolds},\SubIndex{special Lagrangian submanifold}\SubIndex{submanifold!special Lagrangian}\SubIndex{Lagrangian submanifold!special} i.e. integral manifolds of both \(\vartheta\) and the imaginary part of \(\Psi\).
\end{problem}

\section{The last character}
We always look for integral manifolds of a particular dimension \(p\).
For simplicity, we can assume that our exterior differential system contains all differential forms of degree \(p+1\) and higher.
In particular, the \(p\)-dimensional integral elements are maximal.
The polar equations of any maximal integral element \(E_p\) cut out precisely \(E_p\), i.e. have rank \(\dim M - p\) on \(E_p\).
We encounter \(s_0, s_1,\dots,s_p\) polar equations at each increment, so rank \(s_0+s_1+\dots+s_p\).
We can find \(s_p\) from the other characters:
\[
s_0+s_1+\dots+s_{p-1}+s_p=\dim M - p.
\]
For even greater simplicity, we take this as a definition for the final character \(s_p\); we only \emph{pretend} that our exterior differential system contains all differential forms of degree \(p+1\) and higher.

\section{Example: harmonic functions}
We will prove the existence of harmonic functions on the plane with given value and first derivatives at a given point.
On \(M=\R[5]_{x,y,u,u_x,u_y}\), let \(\II\) be the exterior differential system generated by 
\begin{align*}
\vartheta & \defeq du-u_x \, dx - u_y \, dy, \\
\Theta &\defeq du_x \wedge dy - du_y \wedge dx.
\end{align*}
Note that
\[
d\vartheta = dx \wedge du_x+dy \wedge du_y
\]
also belongs to \(\II\) because any exterior differential system is closed under exterior derivative.
Any integral surface \(X\) on which \(0 \ne dx \wedge dy\) is locally the graph of a harmonic function \(u=u(x,y)\) and its derivatives \(u_x = \pderiv{u}{x}\), \(u_x = \pderiv{u}{x}\).

Each integral plane \(E_2\) (i.e. integral element of dimension \(2\)) on which \(dx \wedge dy \ne 0\) is given by equations
\begin{align*}
du_x &= u_{xx} dx + u_{xy} dy, \\
du_y &= u_{yx} dx + u_{yy} dy, \\
\end{align*}
for a unique choice of \(4\) constants \(u_{xx}, u_{xy}, u_{yx}, u_{yy}\)
subject to the \(2\) equations \(u_{xy}=u_{yx}\) and \(0=u_{xx}+u_{yy}\).
Hence integral planes at each point have dimension \(2\).
The space of integral planes has dimension \(\dim M + 2 = 5+2=7\).

Every integral line is the span \(E_1=\spn{v}\) of a vector
\[
v = \pr{\dot{x},\dot{y},u_x \dot{x} + u_y\dot{y}, u_{xx} \dot{x}+u_{xy} \dot{y}, u_{yx} \dot{x} + u_{yy}\dot{y}}.
\]
Compute
\[
v \hook
\begin{pmatrix}
d\vartheta \\
\Theta
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
\dot{x} \, du_x  + \dot{y} \, du_y - \pr{u_{xx} \dot{x} + u_{xy} \dot{y}} \, dx - \pr{u_{yx} \dot{x} + u_{yy} \dot{y}} \, dy \\
\dot{y} \, du_x -\dot{x} \, du_y 
+ \pr{u_{xx} \dot{x} + u_{xy} \dot{y}} \, dy 
-
\pr{u_{yx} \dot{x} + u_{yy} \dot{y}} \, dx
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
and
\[
\begin{array}{@{}r@{}c@{}lll@{}}
\toprule\multicolumn{3}{@{}l@{}}{\textrm{Flag}} & 
\textrm{Polar equations} & \textrm{Characters}\\
\cmidrule(r){1-3}\cmidrule(lr){4-4}\cmidrule(l){5-5}
E_0&=&\set{0}&\spn{\vartheta} & s_0=1 \\
E_1&=&\spn{v}&\spn{\vartheta, v\hook d\vartheta, v\hook \Theta} & s_1=2 \\
\bottomrule
\end{array}
\]
We are only interested in finding integral surfaces; we compute the final character from
\[
s_0+s_1+s_2=\dim M - 2.
\]
The characters are \(s_0,s_1,s_2=1,2,0\) with predicted dimension \(\dim M + s_1 + 2 s_2 = 5 + 2 + 2 \cdot 0 = 7\): involution.
So harmonic functions exist near any point of the plane, with prescribed value and first derivatives at that point.
\prob{eds:unbun}{What are the integral elements and integral manifolds of the exterior differential system generated by \(du\wedge dx, dv\wedge dx,u\,du\wedge dv\) on \(\R[4]_{x,y,u,v}\)?}
\begin{problem}{eds:pde}
Consider the partial differential equation
\[
u_{xx}=f(x,y,u,u_x,u_y,u_{xy},u_{yy}).
\]
Apply the Cartan--K\"ahler theorem to the associated exterior differential system.
\end{problem}
\begin{answer}{eds:pde}
Take \(M\defeq\R[7]_{x,y,u,u_x,u_y,u_{xy},u_{yy}}\) with the exterior differential system \(\II\) generated by
\begin{align*}
\theta_1&\defeq du-u_x\,dx-u_y\,dy,\\
\theta_2&\defeq du_x-f\,dx-u_{xy}\,dy,\\
\theta_3&\defeq du_y-u_{xy}\,dx-u_{yy}\,dy.
\end{align*}
The polar equations of the zero dimensional integral element \(\spn{0}\) are \(\spn{\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3}\).
Compute
\begin{align*}
d\theta_1&=-du_x\wedge dx-du_y\wedge dy,\\
d\theta_2&=-df\wedge dx-du_{xy}\wedge dy,\\
d\theta_3&=-du_{xy}\wedge dx-du_{yy}\wedge dy
\end{align*}
where
\[
df=f_x dx + f_y dy+f_u du+f_{u_x}du_x+f_{u_y}du_y+f_{u_{xy}}du_{xy}+f_{u_{yy}}du_{yy}.
\]
A \(1\)-dimensional integral element is the span of some nonzero vector \(v\) so that 
\[
0=v\hook\theta_1=v\hook\theta_2=v\hook\theta_3.
\]
We are only looking for integral surfaces which are graphs of \(x,y\).
So we can suppose that \(v\) has nonzero \(\partial_x\) or \(\partial_y\) component, i.e. projection to the \(x,y\)-plane.
If we write out 
\[
v=a \, \partial_x + b\, \partial_y + c\, \partial_u + e \, \partial_{u_x} + g \, \partial_{u_y} + k\, \partial_{u_{xy}} + \ell\, \partial_{u_{yy}},
\]
plug in to find precisely the equations
\begin{align*}
c&=au_x+bu_y,\\
e&=af+bu_{xy},\\
g&=au_{xy}+bu_{yy}.
\end{align*}
So the \(1\)-dimensional integral elements on which \(dx\ne 0\) are parameterized by, scaling to get \(a=1\), the values of \(b,k,\ell\), or for those with \(dy\ne 0\), scaling to get \(b=1\), the values of \(a,k,\ell\).

The polar equations of a \(1\)-dimensional integral element \(\spn{v}\) on which \(dx\ne 0\) are spanned by \(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3\) together with
\begin{align*}
v\hook d\theta_1&=du_x-f\,dx-u_{xy}dy+b(du_y-u_{xy}dx-u_{yy}dy),\\
&=\theta_2+b\theta_3,\\
v\hook d\theta_2&=(f_y-k)dy-A\,dx+f_u du + f_{u_x} du_x + f_{u_y} du_y\\
&\qquad+ (f_{u_{xy}}+b)du_{xy}+f_{u_{yy}}du_{yy}
,\\
v\hook d\theta_3&=-k\,dx+du_{xy}-\ell\,dy+b\,du_{yy}
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
A&=f_yb+f_u(u_x+bu_y)+f_{u_x}(f+bu_{xy})\\
&\qquad+f_{u_y}(u_{xy}+bu_{yy})+f_{u_{xy}} k +f_{u_{yy}}\ell.
\end{align*}
With generic choice of \(k\), we find linearly independent \(du_x,dy,du_{xy}\) components.
So the generic integral line has a \(5\)-dimensional space of polar equations.
The polar equations have increased from \(3\) to \(5\), so \(s_1=5-3=2\).
So \(s_0=3,s_1=2\); by our general recipe if we want to enforce that the maximal integral elements will have dimension \(2\), \(s_0+s_1+s_2=\dim M-2\), so \(s_0,s_1,s_2=3,2,0\).

Each \(2\)-dimensional integral element on which \(dx\wedge dy\ne 0\) is parameterized by choosing two such vectors, one with \(a=1,b=0\) and the other with \(a=0,b=1\), say
\begin{align*}
v&=\partial_x + u_x\, \partial_u + f \, \partial_{u_x} + u_{xy} \, \partial_{u_y} + k\, \partial_{u_{xy}} + \ell\, \partial_{u_{yy}},\\
w&=\partial_y + u_y\, \partial_u + u_{xy}\, \partial_{u_x} + u_{yy} \, \partial_{u_y} + K\, \partial_{u_{xy}} + L\, \partial_{u_{yy}}.
\end{align*}
But these coefficients are not arbitrary: they still have precisely to pass the test of making \(0=d\theta_1=d\theta_2=d\theta_3\) so that the span \(\spn{v,w}\) is an integral plane.
Plug in to see that
\begin{align*}
d\theta_1(v,w)&=0,\\
d\theta_2(v,w)&=f_y+f_u u_y + f_{u_x} u_{xy} + f_{u_y} u_{yy} + f_{u_{xy}} K + f_{u_{yy}} u_{yy} -k,\\
d\theta_3(v,w)&=K-\ell.
\end{align*}
So \(\spn{v,w}\) is an integral plane just when these vanish, giving an equation for \(k\) and one for \(\ell\), hence the values of \(K,L\) are arbitrary, a \(2\)-dimensional space of integral elements at each point of the \(7\)-dimensional manifold \(M\).
The space of integral elements has therefore dimension \(9\).
The generic flag predicts dimension \(\dim M + s_1 + 2s_2=7+2+0=9\).
The predicted dimension equals the dimension, so the Cartan--K\"ahler theorem applies: the generic integral plane lies tangent to an analytic integral surface.
There is an involutive integral element at every point of \(M\), so at each point, the generic integral plane lies tangent to an analytic integral surface, so there are integral surfaces through every point.
\end{answer}
\begin{problem*}{eds:5.variable}
Take a coupled system of two \nth{2} order partial differential equations
\begin{align*}
u_{xx}&=f,\\
u_{xy}&=g,
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
f&=f(x,y,u,u_x,u_y,u_{yy}),\\
g&=g(x,y,u,u_x,u_y,u_{yy}).
\end{align*}
Find the integral lines and integral planes.
Under what conditions on the first partial derivatives of \(f,g\) is there more than one integral plane at the generic point on which \(dx,dy\) are linearly independent?
\end{problem*}
\begin{answer}{eds:5.variable}
Let
\[
M\defeq\R[6]_{x,y,u,u_x,u_y,u_{yy}},
\]
with the exterior differential system \(\II\) generated by
\begin{align*}
\theta_0&=du-u_xdx-u_ydy,\\
\theta_1&=du_x-u_{xx}dx-u_{xy}dy,\\
&=du_x-f\,dx-g\,dy\\
\theta_2&=du_y-u_{xy}dx-u_{yy}dy,\\
&=du_y-g\,dx-u_{yy}dy.
\end{align*}
The integral surfaces of \(\II\) on which \(dx,dy\) are linearly independent are precisely the local solutions of the coupled system.

Consider the integral lines, i.e. \(1\)-dimensional integral elements.
Any integral line is the span of some nonzero vector
\[
v=
\dot{x}\partial_x+
\dot{y}\partial_y+
\dot{u}\partial_u+
\dot{u}_x\partial_{u_x}+
\dot{u}_y\partial_{u_y}+
\dot{u}_{yy}\partial_{u_{yy}}.
\]
The span of \(v\) is an integral element just when \(0=\theta_0=\theta_1=\theta_2\) on \(v\), i.e.
\begin{align*}
\dot{u}&=u_x\dot{x}+u_y\dot{y},\\
\dot{u}_x&=f\dot{x}+g\dot{y},\\
\dot{u}_y&=g\dot{x}+u_{yy}\dot{y}.
\end{align*}
Each integral line is determined by choosing \(\dot{x},\dot{y},\dot{u}_{yy}\) arbitrarily, not all zero.
These choices are uniquely determined then by the integral line up to scaling all three by any nonzero constant.
So there is a \(2\)-dimensional space of integral lines at each point of the \(6\)-dimensional manifold \(M\), and this space is a real projective plane.

Before we find the integral planes, we need the exterior derivatives of \(\theta_0,\theta_1,\theta_2\).
Compute modulo \(\theta_0,\theta_1,\theta_2\): \(d\theta_0=0\) and
\begin{align*}
d\theta_1&=

Each integral plane, i.e. \(2\)-dimensional integral element, is spanned by a pair of vectors \(X,Y\) which themselves span integral lines, and which together satisfy 
\[
0=d\theta_0=d\theta_1=d\theta_2.
\]
Since we are concerned only with integral curves and integral surfaces that project by local diffeomorphism to the \(xy\)-plane, we need consider only the integral planes that project by linear isomorphism to the \(xy\)-plane.
Any basis of the \(xy\)-plane has a unique basis of the integral element projecting to it.
So we take the standard basis of the \(xy\)-plane, and insist that \(X,Y\) project to it.
This gives us the \(\partial_x,\partial_y\) components of \(X,Y\), and the equations on integral lines determine the
\[
\partial_u,\partial_{u_x},\partial_{u_y}
\]
components as above.
Putting this together,
\begin{align*}
X&=\partial_x+u_x\partial_u+f\partial_{u_x}+g\partial_{u_y}+a\partial_{u_{yy}},\\
Y&=\partial_y+u_y\partial_u+g\partial_{u_x}+u_{yy}\partial_{u_y}+b\partial_{u_{yy}},
\end{align*}
for two constants \(a,b\), which have to satisfy some more equations.
So far, we have only ensured that \(X,Y\) project to the standard basis and each separately spans an integral line.
To in addition span together an integral plane, we need them to satisfy
\[
0=d\theta_0=d\theta_1=d\theta_2.
\]
We check that
\[
d\theta_0(X,Y)=1\cdot g-1\cdot g=0.
\]
Then
\begin{align*}
d\theta_1(X,Y)
&=
(f_y-g_x+f_u u_y-g_u u_x
+f_{u_x}g-g_{u_x}f
+f_{u_y}u_{yy}-g_{u_y}g
)dx\wedge dy(X,Y)
\\
&\qquad+
(f_{u_{yy}} dx+g_{u_{yy}}dy)\wedge du_{yy}(X,Y),
\\
&=
f_y-g_x+f_u u_y-g_u u_x
+f_{u_x}g-g_{u_x}f
+f_{u_y}u_{yy}-g_{u_y}g
\\
&\qquad+
f_{u_{yy}}b -g_{u_{yy}}a,
\end{align*}
while
\begin{align*}
d\theta_2(X,Y)
&=
(g_y+g_u u_y + g_{u_x} g + g_{u_y} u_{yy}) dx\wedge dy(X,Y)
\\
&\qquad
+(g_{u_{yy}} dx+dy)\wedge du_{yy}(X,Y),
\\
&=g_y+g_u u_y + g_{u_x} g + g_{u_y} u_{yy} 
\\
&\qquad
+
g_{u_{yy}}b-a.
\end{align*}
This equation solves for \(a\):
\[
a=g_y+g_u u_y + g_{u_x} g + g_{u_y} u_{yy}+g_{u_{yy}}b.
\]
So there is at most a \(1\)-dimensional space of integral planes at each point of the \(6\)-dimensional manifold \(M\).

To have a \(1\)-dimensional space of integral planes, we need precisely that this choice of \(a\) satisfies the previous equation on \(a,b\) coming from \(0=d\theta_1\):
\begin{align*}
0&=
f_y-g_x+f_u u_y-g_u u_x
+f_{u_x}g-g_{u_x}f
+f_{u_y}u_{yy}-g_{u_y}g
\\
&\qquad+
f_{u_{yy}}b -g_{u_{yy}}(g_y+g_u u_y + g_{u_x} g + g_{u_y} u_{yy}+g_{u_{yy}}b),\\
&=
f_y-g_x+f_u u_y-g_u u_x
+f_{u_x}g-g_{u_x}f
+f_{u_y}u_{yy}-g_{u_y}g
\\
&\qquad+
f_{u_{yy}}b 
-g_{u_{yy}}(g_y+g_u u_y + g_{u_x} g + g_{u_y} u_{yy})
-g^2_{u_{yy}}b),\\
\\
&=
f_y-g_x+f_u u_y-g_u u_x
+f_{u_x}g-g_{u_x}f
+f_{u_y}u_{yy}-g_{u_y}g
-g_{u_{yy}}(g_y+g_u u_y + g_{u_x} g + g_{u_y} u_{yy})
\\
&\qquad+
(f_{u_{yy}}
-g_{u_{yy}}^2)b,\\
\end{align*}
The space of integral planes at each point is \(1\)-dimensional just when the linear term vanishes so that it doesn't constrain \(b\):
\[
f_{u_{yy}}
=g^2_{u_{yy}}
\]
and the constant term vanishes, so that every \(b\) solves:
\[
0=
f_y-g_x+f_u u_y-g_u u_x
+f_{u_x}g-g_{u_x}f
+f_{u_y}u_{yy}-g_{u_y}g
-g_{u_{yy}}(g_y+g_u u_y + g_{u_x} g + g_{u_y} u_{yy}).
\]

If the linear term in \(b\) doesn't vanish then, at every point of \(M\), there is a unique integral plane on which \(dx,dy\) are linearly independent.
We will reconsider this problem in problem~\vref{problem:eds:5.variable.2}.

If the linear term vanishes, and the constant term doesn't, then there are no integral planes on which \(dx,dy\) are linearly independent: any choice of \(X,Y\) will not span an integral plane.
Tangent planes of any integral surface are integral planes.
So there are no integral surfaces on which \(x\) and \(y\) are local coordinates.
So there are no local solutions \(u=u(x,y)\) to the original pair of partial differential equations.

If the linear term and the constant term both vanish, we don't know if there are any integral surfaces.
We will reconsider this problem in problem~\vref{problem:test:eds:5.variable.3}.

\begin{problem}{v.b.rank}
Prove: constant rank linear equations, depending analytically on parameters, have a local solution depending analytically on those parameters.
\end{problem}
\begin{answer}{v.b.rank}
Suppose that, to each point \(x\in M\) of a manifold \(M\), we have an associated \(p \times q\) matrix \(\varphi(x)\), with entries analytic functions on \(M\).
Let \(K\) be the set of pairs \((x,v)\) so that \(x \in M\) and \(v\) is a vector in the kernel of \(\varphi(x)\).
If \(\varphi(x)\) has rank independent of \(x\), let us prove that \(K\) is an embedded submanifold of \(M \times \R[q]\).
Let's also prove that, for any map \(w\colon M \to \R[p]\), the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item At every point \(x \in M\), there is a vector \(v\) so that \(\varphi(v)=w(x)\).
\item Near every point \(x \in M\), there is an analytic vector valued function \(v\) on an open subset of \(M\), so that \(\varphi(v(x))=w(x)\); if \(\varphi\) is 1-1 at every point \(x \in M\), then \(v\) is unique.
\end{enumerate} 
We can change \(\varphi\) by multiplying by arbitrary invertible matrices of analytic functions.
Since \(\varphi\) has constant rank, for any chosen point of \(M\), we can permute rows and columns to get the upper left corner to be invertible at that point, and hence near that point, of the same rank as \(\varphi\):
\[
\varphi=
\begin{pmatrix}
A&B\\
C&D
\end{pmatrix},
\]
with \(A\) invertible.
Multiply by 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
A^{-1}&0\\
0&I
\end{pmatrix},
\]
to get \(A=I\).
Having rank exactly that of the upper left corner is precisely \(D=CB\).
Multiply:
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
I&0\\
-C&I
\end{pmatrix}
\varphi
\begin{pmatrix}
I&-B\\
0&I
\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}
I&0\\
0&I
\end{pmatrix}.

(They need not form a basis.)

Then there is a unique symmetric matrix \(A=\pr{a_{ij}}\) of analytic functions so that \(\alpha_i = \sum a_{ij} \xi_j\).
\end{lemma}
\begin{problem}{Cartans.lemma}Prove Cartan's lemma using the solution of problem~\ref{problem:v.b.rank}.
\end{problem}
\begin{answer}{Cartans.lemma}
We prove it in each tangent space separately.
Real analyticity then follows from the uniqueness of solutions of the linear equations by problem~\vref{problem:v.b.rank}.
So we prove it for constant coefficient \(1\)-forms in \(\R[p]\).
Choose  basis in \(\R[p]\) so that in coordinates 
\[
x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k, y_1, y_2, \dots, y_{p-k}
\]
our \(1\)-forms are \(\xi_i = dx_i\).
Write \(\alpha_i = \sum a_{ij} dx_j + \sum b_{i\ell} dy_{\ell}\), say.
The equation \(0=\alpha_1 \wedge \xi_1 + \alpha_2 \wedge \xi_2 + \dots + \alpha_k \wedge \xi_k\) is precisely
\begin{align*}
0 &= 
\sum_j a_{ij} dx_j \wedge dx_i +
\sum_{\ell} b_{i\ell} dy_{\ell} \wedge dx_i,
\\
&=
\frac{1}{2}\sum_j \pr{a_{ij}-a_{ji}} dx_j \wedge dx_i +
\sum_{\ell} b_{i\ell} dy_{\ell} \wedge dx_i,
\end{align*}
Plugging in the unit vectors pointing along various coordinate axes, we find \(a_{ij}=a_{ji}\) and \(b_{i{\ell}}=0\).

\begin{theorem}[Frobenius]\SubIndex{Frobenius theorem}\SubIndex{theorem!Frobenius}

The following are equivalent; if any, hence all, hold we say that \(\II\) is \emph{Frobenius}.\define{Frobenius!exterior differential system}
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
Every integral element of \(\II\) lies in a unique \(p\)-dimensional integral element.
\item
There is a constant so that \(\II\) has a \(p\)-dimensional integral element at each point of \(M\), with character \(s_0\) equal to that constant, and all other characters \(s_1,s_2,\dots,s_p\) vanishing.
\item
\(\II\) has an involutive \(p\)-dimensional integral element at each point of \(M\).

They span a \(p\)-dimensional linear subspace in each tangent space of \(M\).

\prob{Frobenius}{Use a statement of the Frobenius theorem from a differential geometry textbook, or lemma~\vref{lemma:Cartan.family}, to prove the Frobenius\SubIndex{Frobenius theorem}\SubIndex{theorem!Frobenius} theorem.}
\begin{example}
To solve both \(u_x=f(x,y,u)\) and \(u_y=g(x,y,u)\), note

so takes the compatibility condition into account.

\begin{problem}{eds:global.Frob.lift}
Suppose that \(\varphi \colon P \to Q\) is a surjective continuous map of manifolds, and that \(P\) carries a Frobenius exterior differential system, on each leaf of which \(\varphi\) restricts to a local homeomorphism to \(Q\).
Suppose that, for any two points of \(P\) above the same point of \(Q\), there is a \(\varphi\)-invariant homeomorphism of a neighborhood of one to a neighborhood of the other, which takes leaves to leaves.
Prove that every leaf is a covering space of \(Q\).
\end{problem}
\begin{answer}{eds:global.Frob.lift}
Take a point \(q_0 \in Q\) and a leaf \(L\).
Take some point \(p_0 \in P\) so that \(\varphi(p_0)=q_0\).
Then \(\varphi\) is a homeomorphism of some open subset \(U\subset L\) containing \(p_0\), to some open subset \(\bar{U}\subset Q\).
We can assume that \(\bar{U}\) is connected, by perhaps replacing \(\bar{U}\) by its component containing \(q_0\) and replacing \(U\) by its intersection with \(\varphi^{-1}\bar{U}\).
Composing \(\varphi\) with any \(\varphi\)-invariant automorphism of the Frobenius system allows us to vary \(U\) with the choice of \(p_0\), but keep the same \(\bar{U}\) for the given \(q_0\).
The inverse image of \(\bar{U}\) up in \(L\) is therefore a union of open subsets of the leaf \(L\).
Suppose two of these overlap, say \(U_0,U_1\subseteq L\) both contain some point \(p_1\), and are both mapped homeomorphically to \(\bar{U}\) by \(\varphi\).
Let \(\varphi_0\defeq\left.\varphi\right|_{U_0}\) and \(\varphi_1\defeq\left.\varphi\right|_{U_1}\).
Since \(\varphi_0\) is a homeomorphism to a connected topological space \(\bar{U}\), \(U_0\) is connected. 
The map \(\varphi_1^{-1}\circ\varphi_0\colon U_0\to U_1\) is a homeomorphism equal to the identity map precisely in \(U_0\cap U_1\), which is an open set.
But the points where a continuous map is the identity form a closed set, hence a component, hence all of \(U_0\).

If \(f_{u_{yy}}\ne g_{u_{yy}}^2\), prove that there are no integral surfaces.
\end{problem*}
\begin{answer}{eds:5.variable.2}
Recall from the solution of problem~\vref{problem:eds:5.variable}, there is precisely one integral element through each point of the \(6\)-dimensional manifold
\[
M\defeq\R[6]_{x,y,u,u_x,u_y,u_{yy}}.
\]
From the Frobenius theorem, there is at most one integral surface through each point, and there is one through every point just when the \(2\)-forms \(d\theta_0,d\theta_1,d\theta_2\) vanish modulo \(\theta_0,\theta_1,\theta_2\).
We already found \(0=d\theta_0\) modulo \(\theta_0,\theta_1,\theta_2\).
When we mod out \(\theta_0,\theta_1,\theta_2\), we are left with three linearly independent \(1\)-forms \(dx,dy,du_{yy}\).
Expressing our \(2\)-forms in these \(1\)-forms, the \(2\)-forms vanish just when their coefficients vanish.
The \(dy\wedge du_{yy}\) term of \(d\theta_2\) is \(1\), so the Frobenius theorem never applies: if \(f_{u_{yy}}\ne g_{u_{yy}}^2\), through the generic point of \(M\) there is no integral surface on which \(x\) and \(y\) are local coordinates.
\end{answer}
\begin{example}
Suppose that \(\theta^1,\theta^2,\theta^3\) are linearly independent \(1\)-forms on a \(6\)-dimensional manifold \(M\), and let \(\II\) be the exterior differential system they generate.
At each point \(m\in M\), they vanish on a \(3\)-dimensional linear subspace, say \(V_m\subset T_m M\).
So \(V_m\) contains any integral elements; all lines in \(V_m\) are integral lines, hence forming a real projective plane.
There are infinitely many integral curves through each point.
The differentials \(d\theta^1,d\theta^2,d\theta^3\) are \(2\)-forms on \(V_m\); we want to ``draw'' them. 
Pick a volume form \(dV_m\) on \(V_m\).
Each \(2\)-form \(\xi\) on \(V_m\) is identified with a vector \(u\in V_m\) by
\[
\xi(v,w)=dV_m(u,v,w),
\]
for any \(v,w\in V_m\).
The \(2\)-form \(\xi\) vanishes on a \(2\)-plane in \(V_m\) just when the associated vector \(u\) lies in the \(2\)-plane.
Our three differentials yield three vectors in the \(3\)-dimensional vector space \(V_m\); integral planes are those which contain all three. 
If those three vectors have span of dimension:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$0$]
All planes in \(V_m\) are integral planes; this holds throughout \(M\) just when \(\II\) is Frobenius, so that \(M\) is foliated by integral \(3\)-manifolds.
\item[$1$]
There is a circle of integral planes: the planes passing through the line spanned by \(u_1,u_2,u_3\) in \(V_m\).
Take an integral line, say the span of some vector \(v\), and suppose that \(v\) is not in the span of these \(u_1,u_2,u_3\).
The polar equations of that integral line vanish only on the plane spanned by \(v\) and these \(u_1,u_2,u_3\), so a \(1\)-dimensional space of polar equations added to the \(s_0=3\) we had.
So \(s_1=1,s_2=0\).
By the Cartan--K\"ahler theorem, if this occurs throughout \(M\), \(\II\) is involutive, with infinitely many integral surfaces through each point.
\item[$2$]
There is a unique integral plane through \(m\): the plane spanned by \(u_1,u_2,u_3\) in \(V_m\).
The generic integral line doesn't lie on it, so \(s_1=2,s_2=0\), and the Cartan--K\"ahler theorem is silent about the integral surfaces.
\item[$3$]
There are no integral planes nor integral surfaces near \(m\).
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
\section{Example: surfaces with constant shape operator}
In this section, we assume familiarity with appendix~\ref{chapter:moving.frame}.
Use the Frobenius theorem:
\prob{Frobenius:zero.shape}{Prove that, for point \(x\in\E[3]\) and plane \(P\) in \(\E[3]\) through \(x\), any connected and embedded surface with zero shape operator passing through \(x\) and tangent to \(P\) at \(x\) is an open subset of \(P\).}
\begin{answer}{Frobenius:zero.shape}
This is already clear geometrically: the shape operator is the curvature of geodesics.
Let \(M\defeq\frameBundleE{3}\) be the frame bundle of \(\E[3]\).
The frame bundle \(\frameBundle{S}\) of any surface \(S\) in \(\E[3]\) satisfies \(\omega_3=0\) and 
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma_{13} \\
\gamma_{23} 
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} \\
a_{21} & a_{22}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\omega_1 \\
\omega_2 
\end{pmatrix}
\]
for some smooth functions \(a_{11}, a_{12}=a_{21}, a_{22}\).
To have vanishing shape operator, \(0=a_{11}=a_{12}=a_{22}\), so
\(0=\omega_3=\gamma_{13}=\gamma_{23}\).

Consider on \(M\) the exterior differential system with equations \(\vartheta_0 = \omega_3, \vartheta_1=\gamma_{13}, \vartheta_2=\gamma_{23}\).
The frame bundle \(\frameBundle{S}\) of any surface with vanishing shape operator is a \(3\)-dimensional integral manifold.
To be precise, each component of \(\frameBundle{S}\) is an integral manifold, since \(S\) might have more than one orientation, so \(\frameBundle{S}\) might have more than one component.
Check that the exterior differential system is Frobenius, so there is a unique integral manifold through each point of \(M\).
But we already have an example of such an integral manifold, so that must be the only one.
\end{answer}
\prob{Frobenius:sphere.unique}{An oriented surface is \emph{\(c_0\)-round}, for a constant \(c_0>0\), if it has shape operator \(\shapeOp(u,v)=c_0 u \cdot v\) at every point.

If \(c_0\ne 0\), prove that any such surface, if connected and embedded, is an open subset of a sphere.}
\begin{answer}{Frobenius:sphere.unique}
Again take \(M=\frameBundleE{3}\) with the exterior differential system
\begin{align*}
\omega_3, \gamma_{13} - c_0 \omega_1, \gamma_{23} - c_0 \omega_2,
\end{align*}
Again the system is Frobenius, so there is only one \(3\)-dimensional integral manifold through each point.
Rotate and translate a sphere of suitable radius to see one such integral manifold through each point of \(M\), the frame bundle of that sphere.
\end{answer}
\prob{Frobenius:cylinder}{Prove that any connected and embedded surface in \(\E[3]\) with constant principal curvatures is an open subset of a plane, sphere or cylinder.}
\begin{answer}{Frobenius:cylinder}
Problem~\vref{problem:Frobenius:sphere.unique} handles the case of one principal curvature, so assume that there are two principal curvatures.
After picking a frame on a surface \(S\) so that \(e_1\) and \(e_2\) are in the principal directions, we find \(0=\omega_3=\gamma_{13}-k_1 \omega_1=\gamma_{23}-k_2 \omega_2\), for constants \(k_1, k_2\).
Differentiate all three equations to find that \(0=\pr{k_1-k_2}\gamma_{12} \wedge \omega_2=\pr{k_1-k_2} \gamma_{12} \wedge \omega_1\), forcing \(\gamma_{12}=0\) by Cartan's lemma.
Differentiating the equation \(\gamma_{12}=0\), we find \(0=k_1 k_2 \omega_1 \wedge \omega_2\) so that either \(k_1=0\) or \(k_2=0\).
We can assume that \(k_1=0\), i.e. \(\gamma_{13}=0\).
But then 
\begin{align*}
de_1
&=
\pr{e_1 \cdot de_1} e_1 +
\pr{e_2 \cdot de_1} e_2 +
\pr{e_3 \cdot de_1} e_3,
\\
&=
\gamma_{11} e_1 +
\gamma_{21} e_2 +
\gamma_{31} e_3,
\\
&=
0.
\end{align*}
Therefore \(e_1\) is constant as we travel along the surface.
So the surface is a collection of straight lines, in this \(e_1\) direction, all placed perpendicular to a curve in the \(e_2, e_3\)-plane.
On that curve, \(\omega_1=0\), and \(d \omega_2=0\) so we can write locally \(\omega_2=ds\) for some function \(s\).
Then we find 
\begin{align*}
de_2
&=
\pr{e_1 \cdot de_2} e_1 +

Rotate so that \(E_1=e_1, E_2, E_3\) are the standard basis vectors of \(\E[3]\), to see that the surface \(S\) is a right circular cylinder of radius \(1/\left|k_2\right|\).

\begin{theorem}
There are infinitely many triply orthogonal webs, depending on \(3\) functions of \(2\) variables, defined near any given point of \(3\)-dimensional Euclidean space.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Picture a triply orthogonal web.
Each leaf is perpendicular to a unique unit length \(1\)-form \(\eta_i\), up to \(\pm\), which satisfies \(0=\eta_i \wedge d \eta_i\), by the Frobenius\SubIndex{Frobenius theorem}\SubIndex{theorem!Frobenius} theorem.
Denote \(3\)-dimensional Euclidean space by \(X\).
Let \(M\) be the set of all orthonormal bases of the tangent spaces of \(X\), with obvious bundle map \(x \colon M \to X\), so that each point of \(M\) has the form \(m=\pr{x,e_1,e_2,e_3}\) for some \(x \in X\) and orthonormal basis \(e_1,e_2,e_3\) of \(T_x X\).
The \emph{soldering \(1\)-forms}\SubIndex{soldering forms} \(\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3\) on \(M\) are defined by 
\[
(v \hook \omega_i)e_i = x_* v.
\]
Note: they are \(1\)-forms on \(M\), not on \(X\).
Let 
\[
\omega
\defeq
\begin{pmatrix}
\omega_1 \\
\omega_2 \\
\omega_3
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
As explained in appendix~\ref{chapter:moving.frame}, there is a unique matrix-valued \(1\)-form \(\pi\), valued in antisymmetric \(3 \times 3\) matrices and known as the \emph{Levi-Civita connection},\define{Levi-Civita connection} so that \(d \omega = -\pi \wedge \omega\), i.e.
\[
d
\begin{pmatrix}
\omega_1 \\
\omega_2 \\
\omega_3
\end{pmatrix}
=
-
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & -\pi_3 & \pi_2 \\
\pi_3 & 0 & -\pi_1 \\
-\pi_2 & \pi_1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\wedge
\begin{pmatrix}
\omega_1 \\
\omega_2 \\
\omega_3
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
Our triply orthogonal web is precisely a section \(X \to M\) of the bundle map \(M \to X\) on which \(0=\omega_i \wedge d\omega_i\) for all \(i\), hence an integral \(3\)-manifold of the exterior differential system \(\II\) on \(M\) generated by the closed \(3\)-forms
\[
\omega_1 \wedge d \omega_1, \quad
\omega_2 \wedge d \omega_2, \quad
\omega_3 \wedge d \omega_3.
\]
Using the equations above, \(\II\) is also generated by
\[
\pi_3 \wedge \omega_{12}, \quad
\pi_1 \wedge \omega_{23}, \quad
\pi_2 \wedge \omega_{31}.
\]
The integral manifolds coframed by \(\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3\) are locally precisely the triply orthogonal webs.
The reader can find the characters: \(s_1,s_2,s_3=0,3,0\).
The integral elements coframed by \(\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3\) form a manifold of dimension \(12\) (parameterized by choice of a point of \(M\) and \(6\) coefficients to determine values of \(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi_3\) at each point of \(M\)): involution.
\end{proof}
The reader familiar with Riemannian geometry will note that this proof works just as well for any \(3\)-dimensional Riemannian manifold.
For more on orthogonal webs in Euclidean space, see \cite{Darboux:1993,DeTurck/Yang:1984,Terng/Uhlenbeck:1998,Zakharov:1998}.
\begin{problem*}{eds:Alin}A question of Alin Albu-Sch\"affer: suppose we are given an analytic foliation of an open subset of \(3\)-dimensional Euclidean space by surfaces.
Is there, at least locally, a triply orthogonal web which has this as one of its three foliations?%
\end{problem*}
\begin{answer}{eds:Alin}
Start by looking at the geometry of the given foliation.
Suppose that the foliation is of an open subset \(U\) of \(3\)-dimensional Euclidean space.
Consider the \(4\)-dimensional manifold \(M\) of all orthonormal frames \(e_1,e_2,e_3\) at points \(x\in U\) for which \(e_3\) is perpendicular to the leaf through \(x\) of the given foliation.
By the Frobenius theorem, 
\begin{align*}
0
&=\omega_3\wedge d\omega_3,
\\
&=\omega_3\wedge(\gamma_{13}\wedge\omega_1+\gamma_{23}\wedge\omega_2),
\\
&=
\gamma_{13}\wedge\omega_1\wedge\omega_3+\gamma_{23}\wedge\omega_2\wedge\omega_3.
\end{align*}
So on \(M\),
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma_{13}\\
\gamma_{23}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}\\
a_{21}&a_{22}&a_{23}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\omega_1\\
\omega_2\\
\omega_3
\end{pmatrix}
\]
for some functions \(a_{ij}\) on \(M\).
Plugging these in above, we find that \(a_{12}=a_{21}\).
Clearly \(a_{11}\omega_1^2+a_{12}\omega_1\omega_2+a_{21}\omega_2\omega_1+a_{22}\omega_2^2\) is the shape operator of each leaf of the foliation.

Now consider the problem of constructing a triply orthogonal web incorporating this foliation as one of its three.
We need to find a choice of \(e_1,e_2\) at each point to construct a frame, so that \(e_1\) will be perpendicular to the leaves of the first foliation, and \(e_2\) perpendicular to the leaves of the second foliation, and the third foliation will be the one we started with, already perpendicular to \(e_3\).
So we will need to solve the exterior differential system
\[
0=\omega_1\wedge d\omega_1=\omega_2\wedge d\omega_2
\]
on \(M\), i.e. with the equations
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma_{13}\\
\gamma_{23}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{11}&a_{12}&a_{13}\\
a_{21}&a_{22}&a_{23}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\omega_1\\
\omega_2\\
\omega_3
\end{pmatrix}
\]
already in force.

Note that on \(M\), \(\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3,\gamma_{12}\) are linearly independent \(1\)-forms.
We are looking for an integral \(3\)-manifold \(X\) of that exterior differential system, on which we want \(\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3\) to be linearly independent, i.e. \(X\) projects by local diffeomorphism to \(3\)-dimensional Euclidean space.

It might be simpler to write our foliation shape operator as
\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\gamma_{13}\\
\gamma_{23}
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
a_{131}&a_{132}&a_{133}\\
a_{231}&a_{232}&a_{233}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\omega_1\\
\omega_2\\
\omega_3
\end{pmatrix}
\]
and then we are imposing only the relations \(a_{132}=a_{231}\), i.e. symmetry in these two outer indices.

Differentiate the equations of our exterior differential system to find that on any integral \(3\)-manifold \(X\):
\begin{align*}
0
&=
\omega_i\wedge d\omega_i,
\\
&=
-\omega_i\wedge\sum_j\gamma_{ij}\wedge\omega_j,
\end{align*}
which forces \(\gamma_{ij}\) to be a linear combination
\[
\gamma_{ij}=\sum_k a_{ijk}\omega_k,
\]
with \(a_{ijk}=-a_{jik}\) since \(\gamma_{ij}=-\gamma_{ji}\).
But plug in to get
\[
0=\omega_i\wedge\sum_{jk}(a_{ijk}-a_{ikj})\omega_k\wedge\omega_j
\]
so that \(a_{ijk}=a_{ikj}\) if \(i,j,k\) are all distinct.
So for distinct indices, \(a_{ijk}\) is symmetric in \(jk\), but antisymmetric in \(ij\).
These two involutions generate the permutation group, and so the sign of \(a_{ijk}\) is a representation of the permutations on \(3\) letters.
But any two involutions are conjugate in the permutation group, so they must force the same sign change.
Hence \(a_{ijk}=0\) for \(i,j,k\) distinct.
This is precisely the demand that the shape operators of the leaves of all three foliations are thus diagonal in the frame \(e_1,e_2,e_3\).
In other words, each leaf of each foliation lies normal to each leaf of each other foliation, and intersects tangent to a principal direction, i.e. along a principal curve.

We can assume that \(U\) is connected.
Either
\begin{enumerate}
\item
the leaves of the given foliation are everywhere umbilic, hence each leaf is an open subset of a sphere or plane, and so \(a_{132}=0\) and \(a_{131}=a_{232}\), or else 
\item
the vectors \(e_1,e_2\) have to be chosen in principal directions and this determines them up to \(4\) choices, at least on a dense open subset of \(U\).
\end{enumerate}

Suppose that the leaves are spheres or planes, so \(a_{132}=0\) and \(a_{131}=a_{232}\), say.
The exterior differential system is generated in dimension \(3\) by \(\gamma_{12}\wedge\omega_1\wedge\omega_2=0\), so every line or plane in any tangent space of \(M\) is an integral element.
Planes, i.e. integral planes, generically have \(\omega_1,\omega_2\) linearly independent on them, so are generically of the form 
\begin{align*}
\gamma_{12}&=p_1\omega_1+p_2\omega_2,\\
\omega_3&=q_1\omega_1+q_2\omega_2,\\
\end{align*}
so lie in a unique \(3\)-dimensional integral element \(\gamma_{12}=p_1\omega_1+p_2\omega_2\).
The polar equations of any integral point or line are trivial, but the generic integral plane has polar equation \(\gamma_{12}-p_1\omega_1-p_2\omega_2\), so \(s_1=0,s_2=1,s_3=0\), solutions depend on \(1\) function of \(2\) variables.

We can explicitly construct the web: take any leaf of our given foliation, the \emph{initial leaf}, and draw on it any foliation by curves.
On that same surface, draw the orthogonal foliation by curves.
Drag each leaf of each of those foliations along the flow of \(e_3\), through space, to trace out a surface.

We want to see that this construction always creates a triply orthogonal web.
Any triply orthogonal web containing the given foliation has to arise from this construction: the leaves of the other two foliations intersect the initial leaf in curves, and the vector field \(e_3\) is tangent to every leaf of the other two foliations.

Conversely, take a foliation of the initial leaf by curves.
Locally pick any orthonormal vector fields \(e_1,e_2\) tangent to that leaf, with \(e_1\) tangent and \(e_2\) perpendicular to that curve foliation.
Drag, as above.
We produce two more foliations of Euclidean space, defined near that leaf.
But it is not clear whether they remain perpendicular.
The leaves of the two new foliations both contain \(e_3\), and they start off perpendicular along the initial leaf.

Compute the change in the Euclidean metric along the flow of \(e_3\):
\[
\LieDer_{e_3} \omega_i\omega_i
=2a_{i3j}\omega_i\omega_j.
\]
So umbilicity of the given leaves is precisely the condition that the Euclidean metric varies only by scaling as we flow along \(e_3\), on the perpendicular vectors to \(e_3\), and so any pair of planes in a tangent space which start perpendicular will remain so.
Hence the construction always succeeds.

Suppose now that the leaves are nowhere umbilic.
We will see that each foliation by nonumbilic surfaces lies in at most one, and typically no, triply orthogonal web.
We need \(e_1,e_2\) to diagonalize the shape operator, i.e. to lie in principal directions.
Imagine drawing the principal curves, i.e. the curves in those directions, on each leaf.
Our given foliation by surfaces has now, on each surface, two foliations by perpendicular curves.
We want to see whether, when we flow along the unit normal vector field \(e_3\) of the foliation, these principal curves flow into one another.
For a generic foliation by surfaces, the flow of \(e_3\) will spin the principal curves of one leaf around into various curves on other leaves, not necessarily principal.

We need \(a_{132}=0\), so the shape operator is diagonalized, i.e. \(e_1,e_2\) point in principal directions, and we suppose the leaves are not umbilic, so \(a_{131}\ne a_{232}\).
Our frames form a \(3\)-manifold \(X\) in the frame bundle.
We have to decide whether \(X\) is an integral manifold.
On \(X\), \(\gamma_{ij}=\sum_k a_{ijk}\omega_k\), for some functions \(a_{ijk}=-a_{jik}\).
To have a triply orthogonal web, we need precisely that \(a_{ijk}=0\) if \(i,j,k\) are distinct, i.e. the shape operators are diagonalized.
This is precisely the condition that the prinicipal curves flow into one another.
\end{answer}


\optionalSection{Generality of integral manifolds}%
If I describe some family of submanifolds as integral manifolds of an exterior differential system, you might find a different description of the same submanifolds as integral manifolds of a different exterior differential system, perhaps on a different manifold, with different characters.
\begin{example} 
A function \(f(x)\) of one variable is equivalent information to having a constant \(f(0)\) and a function \(df/dx\) of one variable.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
We will solve \(\nabla \times u=f-u\) for an unknown vector field \(u\) in \(3\)-dimensional Euclidean space two ways: an elementary approach~\vpageref{page:nabla.u.f.u}, and following Cartan's strategy in problem~\vref{problem:tableaux:nabla}.
The first approach uses \(1\) function of \(1\) variable and \(2\) functions of \(2\) variables.
The second approach uses \(3\) constants, \(3\) functions of \(1\) variable and \(2\) functions of \(2\) variables.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
Lagrangian submanifolds of \(\C[n]\) depend on \(1\) function of \(n\) variables: those which are graphs \(y=y(x)\) are of the form
\[
y = \pderiv{S}{x}
\]
for some potential function \(S(x)\), unique up to adding a constant.
On the other hand, the proof of the Cartan--K\"ahler theorem builds up each Lagrangian manifold from a choice of \(1\) function of \(1\) variable, \(1\) function of \(2\) variables, and so on.
\end{example}
We will see that Cartan's proof of the Cartan--K\"ahler theorem constructs the general solution of any involutive exterior differential system, using \(s_0\) constants, \(s_1\) functions of \(1\) variable, \(s_2\) functions of \(2\) variables, and so on.
We ``trust'' the last nonzero \(s_p\) of an involutive exterior differential system to give the generality of integral manifolds: they depend on \(s_p\) functions of \(p\) variables, but we don't ``trust'' \(s_0, s_1, \dots, s_{p-1}\).
\begin{example}Immersed plane curves are the integral curves of \(\II=0\) on \(M=\R[2]\).
Any integral flag has \(s_0,s_1=0,1\).
Immersed plane curves are also the integral curves of the ideal \(\JJ\) generated by
\[
\vartheta \defeq \sin \phi \, dx - \cos \phi \, dy
\]
on \(M\defeq \R[2]_{x,y} \times S^1_{\phi}\).
Here \(s_0,s_1=1,1\).
\end{example}


\section{What could go wrong?}
\begin{example}
On \(M\defeq\R[3]_{x,y,z}\), take the ideals \(\II\) generated by \(dx\wedge dz, dy\wedge dz\) and \(\JJ\) generated by \(dx\wedge dz, dy\wedge(dz-y \, dx)\).
At the origin, these differential forms are identical, so the integral elements and characters are the same at that point.
But \(\II\) has integral surfaces \(z=\text{constant}\), while \(\JJ\) does not have integral surfaces.
\end{example}
\prob{Wrong}{Compute characters and dimensions of spaces of integral elements for these.
Show that the Cartan--K\"ahler theorem does not apply.
Find their integral surfaces.}

\section{Generalizations}
The Cartan--K\"ahler theorem also holds for holomorphic exterior differential systems on complex manifolds, formal power series exterior differential systems, and Denjoy--Carleman exterior differential systems, with the same proof.
In particular, any involutive smooth exterior differential system is also a formal power series system about each point, so has formal power series solutions,  perhaps divergent.
The theorem also holds for certain smooth systems \cite{Kakie:1989,Kakie:2008,Yang:1987}.
